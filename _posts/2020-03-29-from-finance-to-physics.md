I often get asked the question "why physics" after telling someone I have a background in finance and economics.
It's a valid question as most often you find people going the other direction, from physics to finance after they've left academia for a higher paying job.
In this post I'll answer that question and detail my journey thus far.
In reality the true title of this post should be "From Finance to Physics with a lot of Computers Along the Way."

A long standing hobby of mine is building and overclocking computers.
I still remember how fascinating it was when I first learned what each of the components do and how to assemble them to get a working computer.
However, I didn't really know much about the programming aspect of computers so I chose computer science as my major when I began studying at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in 2009.
After my first year I decided that learning programming in a classroom environment just wasn't for me.

I switched to studying business the following year with the idea that I would take some business classes to see if there was a major that piqued my interest.
After finishing most of my core classes I ended up joining the (the UTSA Investment Society)[https://www.theinvestmentsociety.com/] and chose to major in finance.
In the investment society students get real world financial experience, from creating models to value equities to actually trading securities.

The Investment Society is sponsored by Professor Ron Sweet, a person who has largely influenced my life in a positive way.
He was the VP of equities and mutual funds at USAA before retiring to teach full time.
He acts as the society's portfolio manager and works with students to pick stocks to allocate portions of the fund towards.
The proceeds from the fund are then used to give micro loans to rural Costa Rican farmers, which in my opinion is a prime example of how much good finance can do in the world.
Every year Professor Sweet flies down to Costa Rica with a group of students to help out the farmers and local community, e.g. planting crops or implementing an irrigation system.

The Investment Society played a large role in sparking my passion for finance; I took every opportunity to get the most from it.
During my senior year I was elected to be a managing director and took on the roles of chief economist and market outlook where I would present financial and economic analysis at the society's weekly meetings.
I was also the senior analyst for the technology hardware and software sectors in which a few junior analysts and I created models to rank the stocks in those sectors and provide recommendations to Professor Sweet.
In my final semester I also led the Investment Society Trading Group where I taught other students about trading equities and options.
Overall, I gained a ton of valuable real-world experience from my time participating in the Investment Society and made some great friends along the way.

In my last year of studies I landed an internship in the Strategic Planning, Price Forecasting, and Market Analysis group at Valero Energy, which was quite convenient as their campus was within walking distance from the university.
My role there was to analyze micro and macroeconomic data so that the company could get a better understanding of the economic landscape.
Even though it was technically an internship, I worked almost full-time and was treated pretty much as an employee.
Before graduating they extended me an offer to stay on as a full-time employee, which I accepted without hesitation.
It was quite an interesting job in the beginning as I had access to vast amounts of data from various sources, and was even lucky enough to have a Bloomberg terminal to pull data from; however, over time I started to get a bit bored.

During this time is when my interest in programming was reignited.
A good friend of mine from the Investment Society had started self-learning programming and was working on creating an algorithmic hedge fund with some other members.
He encouraged me to get into it as well and we started to have weekly programming meetups where we would pick a small project for fun and work on it together.
My desire to learn more kept growing throughout this time and eventually I decided I wanted to go back to university.

I'd always been curious about physics because to me it's the study of everything from the most fundamental level.
I started looking at universities to apply to and decided on a physics bachelor's program in Leipzig, Germany taught in English.
Now most people also ask me "why Germany?".
There's multiple reasons I chose Germany, but the main one was the opportunity to live abroad and experience a different culture.

Unfortunately my finance degree did not prepare me well enough mathematically to do a master's in physics, but I feel it worked out for the better as I was able to experience a physics education from the ground up.
I spent several hours a day for about three months brushing up my math skills covering topics ranging from basic trigonometry and algebra to calculus on platforms such as Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare.

During my studies I fell in love with theoretical and computational physics and learning just how beautiful our universe can be when represented in the language of mathematics.
I really enjoy using programming to model problems as often I gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics from it.
I took as many computational oriented classes as I could, and eventually did my thesis in the computational physics group on the topic of percolation theory.

All in all, I'd say that going back university to learn learn physics was the best decision I have ever made; I gained a new perspective on the world and the ability to better understand the world around me.
I met a lot of interesting people and made some good friends along the way.

I also really enjoyed my time living in Leipzig, Germany.
It's a peaceful city with a lot of beautiful nature around and some lakes in the south which are great to bike to on a hot summer day.
The German people are nice and welcoming, brew good beer, and know how to have a proper techno party.

That's my journey from finance to physics so far, but there's no telling what the future might hold in store!
