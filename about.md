I am a math/physics/computer/finance nerd and my main drive is curiosity.
I get a lot of enjoyment from figuring out solutions to interesting problems, especially when they involve computations.
Computers have always been a hobby of mine and I like all aspects from hardware to software.
My academic background is in finance, physics, and data science, and I have worked professionally as an economics analyst, a software engineer, and a data scientist.
I am currently working in the field of quantitative finance/trading applying machine learning models to time series data.

Physics and mathematics are among my greatest passions, and I find the field of quantum computation and quantum information particularly interesting.
Mathematics is a beautiful language and the tool we use to model the world around us, but unfortunately, most real world problems are too complex to model exactly, which is where data science and computers come in handy.
With access to powerful computers and large amounts of data, we can leverage machine learning models to find hidden patterns within the data and extract information that we as humans might not be able to ourselves.

I am a big fan of self-learning, and the technology of today enables us to make the most of that. Computers and the internet bring endless information to our fingertips, and a lot of great people and organizations publish high-quality resources online for all to access freely (check out my [resources page](/resources) for some recommendations).
I really like MITâ€™s Open Course Ware; I have been through more of their courses than I can count and learned an invaluable amount.
Being able to watch some of the world's best professors lecture from the comfort of our homes is truly amazing!

If you like topics in the intersection of finance, physics, and data science, then you might find my master's thesis [*Quantum Boltzmann Machines: Applications in Quantitative Finance*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13295) and the corresponding [qbm Python package](https://github.com/cameronperot/qbm/) to train and analyze QBMs on D-Wave quantum annealers interesting.

Besides all of the nerdy stuff, in my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling, hiking, and exploring nature. One of my favorite things to do when traveling is to go to a supermarket and check out the local foods :)
